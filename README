This tool updates bugzilla entries with information
from OBS submit requests that mention bnc#

For this to work you need a ~/.bugzillarc with
$username="yourbugzillaaccount";
$password="xxx";
$namespace="openSUSE:";

To use this tool with bnc's XMLRPC,
you need an account with the corporate flag set

Once configs are in place, configure via crontab -e
0 * * * * cd ~/obsbugzilla && ./checknewobs.pl
