This tool updates bugzilla entries with information
from OBS submit requests that mention bnc#

For this to work you need a ~/.bugzillarc with
$username="yourbugzillaaccount";
$password="xxx";
$namespace="openSUSE:";

INSTALL:
  zypper in perl-SOAP-Lite perl-XMLRPC-Lite

To use this tool with bnc's XMLRPC,
you need an account with the corporate flag set

Once configs are in place, configure via crontab -e
0 * * * * cd ~/obsbugzilla && ./checknewobs.pl


Implementation details:
The script maintains an issuemention.dbm file about mentions that were already processed in order to avoid duplicates in bugzilla, even when it misbehaves.
